## Rust Base App Template for AWESOME-APP

**See [awesomeapp.org](https://awesomeapp.org) for more info**

Base desktop application code with Tauri, Native Web Components and SurrealDB (follow the VMES app architecture)

## Hot Reload dev

For hot-reload UI and Tauri development, run the following in your VSCode from this root folder: 

```sh
awesome-app dev
```

> This assumes `awesome-app` was installed locally (e.g., `cargo install awesome-app`)
